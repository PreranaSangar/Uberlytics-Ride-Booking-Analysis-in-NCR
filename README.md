# Uberlytics – Ride Booking Analysis in NCR 🚖📊
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Uber ride bookings in the National Capital Region (NCR). The goal is to extract insights into ride demand patterns, customer behavior, peak booking times, and other factors influencing ride-hailing trends.

By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify:

Popular routes and ride types

Peak hours and seasonal demand

Distribution of fare amounts & distances

Key trends for decision-making and optimization

📊 Insights

Peak ride demand occurs during office commute hours (8–10 AM, 5–8 PM)

Weekends show a higher percentage of leisure trips compared to weekdays

Certain routes consistently show high demand & surge pricing

Ride type preference varies with time and distance (UberGo vs UberXL, etc.)
